Dent: OpenGL game library
=========================

Dent is a simple OpenGL 4 game engine written in Python. Dent has support
for asset importing, shader management and event handling, as well as a
plug-and-play deferred rendering pipeline.

There is no editor for Dent projects (yet): everything is simply pure Python
files (and assets etc.) as it is meant to be.

The best way to learn about it is by `examples
<https://www.github.com/rspencer01/model-viewer/>`_ and tutorials.
